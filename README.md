# `udltool`

A (currently) commandline tool for managing a DJ library by adding tags to files in your library. Currently, `udltool` can move beatgrids, hotcues, etc. in and out of various software (list TBD).

Right now, it's just a test, but I'm working on a "standard" format for DJ libraries. I don't have much time to work on this right now, so it just does what I need it to.
